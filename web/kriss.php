		Kharagpur Robotics and Intelligent Systems Seminars, or KRISS, has been initiated by Technology Robotix Society with a view to bring together people across departments and years in IIT Kharagpur, to discuss and exchange ideas related to more mature and nuanced areas of robotics. The primary motivation is to encourage feedback and potential collaboration between interested individuals, and also to foster a general culture of research-oriented discussions.<br/><br/>
        Speakers may give talks related to a variety of purposes, like internship reports, presentations of thesis work or other research projects they are involved in, rehearsal talks for upcoming conferences, and even discussions of recent papers that they found interesting and relevant.
