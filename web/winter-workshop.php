		Another initiative of the Technology Robotix Society, the Winter Workshop is conducted in two phases every year during the winter break, for the first year students of IIT Kharagpur, and for anybody else who is interested. Students come together in groups of 10 to 15, under multiple senior mentors, to build a fully functioning autonomous robot from scratch. There are several tracks, with different focal points, like Grid Following, Obstacle Avoidance, PID Control-based locomotion, and Computer Vision.<br/><br/>
		It is in a sense the culmination of the KRAIG sessions that are conducted over the semester, prior to winter, but there is just as much scope for someone who has not been a part of KRAIG, as classes and sessions are also held during the workshop to cover the important concepts. The Winter Workshop is essential to giving students a full-fledged experience of designing, building and debugging a robot, and motivates many of them to join the long-term projects on campus thereafter. <br/><hr/>
