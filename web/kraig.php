         Kharagpur Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Group, or KRAIG, is the focal point for the first year students to become familiar with the basics of hobby robotics. It is supervised by the Technology Robotix Society of IIT Kharagpur. KRAIG involves the interested freshmen in classes and hands-on sessions throughout their first semester. Experienced senior students who have worked on full-scale projects themselves, are there to guide the newcomers as they take their baby steps into this interesting and fascinating world.<br/><br/>
         KRAIG holds weekly sessions, covering a range of topics related to amateur robotics, from simple locomotion systems, to mechanical contraptions, to sensors and actuators, and finally to micro-controller programming and integration. Along the way, there are competitions and special workshops to give the members an opportunity to test their knowledge. <br/><br/>
         The Fresherâ€™s Robosoccer Challenge is conducted soon after KRAIG commences, and invites students to build simple soccer-playing robots and face-off with each other. Later on in the semester, a day-long workshop is held where students build a simple autonomous robot, such as a line follower.
