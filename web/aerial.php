The aim of this project is to create an autonomous quadrotor, capable of balancing itself, 

and will be capable of stable flight. It will also be able to track moving robots on the 

ground and interact with them in a new innovative way. It will be self-aware and able 

to navigate autonomously in a own environment. To get a headstart on our objective, 

we plan to participate in the International Aerial Competition â€“ the longest running 

collegiate aerial challenge in the world. The ultimate of this project is to develop an 

autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle which is aware of its surroundings and capable of 

navigating in indoor and outdoor environments. The project will be industry ready with 

several applications in the fields of surveillance, 3D environment mapping and further 

applications which can be achieved using a team of such robots. The long term goals 

include developing our own carbon fibre prototype, with custom built PCBs.
