	This project has got a potential benefits in exploration of a rugged terrain where Human  fails in maneuvering due to the instability of their body dynamics as well as in reaching  hazardous places, which are immensely dangerous for a human being to move through. This project is to develop a robotic non-wheeled framework having the capability to go through the utmost rugged terrains as well as to exercise immense stability. The biped being a highly unstable system a quadruped is been assumed to have more stability and thus, will be used for this purpose. These bots should have in them in-built push recovery modules so as to balance themselves from any sudden thrust.
