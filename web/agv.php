Team AGV envisions making an autonomous vehicle that is not only practically feasible

but also economically viable. Our approach is mainly concerned with the optimization 

and implementation of the existing techniques to get a better speed safety trade off. Our 

areas of research are primarily computer vision, control systems, machine learning, 

SLAM, motion planning and localization. The team has been successful in developing 

static and pedestrian obstacle avoidance systems, automatic steering system, and low 

cost 3D lidar using 2D lidar systems, among others. The successful completion of this 

project has the potential to drastically improve the transport system. It will also lead to 

development of ancillary technologies in both opencast as well as underground mine 

mapping, collision avoidance system, aiding people with situational awareness data etc.
