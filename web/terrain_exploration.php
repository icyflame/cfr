The aim of this project is to design a team of coordinating robots which use swarm 

intelligence to achieve a number of objectives related to navigation and mapping in 

successive stages. The first stage involves the optimal coverage and patrolling of a large 

known environment. The second involves creating a 3D map of an indoor environment. 

The final stage is to navigate and explore an unknown outdoor terrain. Swarm robotics is 

a major contemporary field of application and research in institutes around the world, not 

to mention a vastly untapped one in India. The potential for use in the industry as well as 

for non-commercial purposes is great.
