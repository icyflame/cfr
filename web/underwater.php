The objective of this project is to facilitate a continuing learning and development 

autonomous systems in underwater robotics. Currently an autonomous underwater 

vehicle (AUV) is being considered in this project. A robotic system working underwater 

in an autonomous mode is a big challenge to design and implementation of complex 

intelligent systems. Students at IIT Kharagpur are being encouraged to take up this at 

various levels and develop innovative solutions. The Research on AUV will focus on 

various aspects of engineering and science through multi-functional cross disciplinary 

groups including innovative mechanical design, control Systems, Machine Vision, 

Precise Navigation, Advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques and development of 

related indigenous technology. <b>Several interesting outcomes are expected from this 

project, namely, a Vision guided and controlled AUV; Navigation system based on 

Acoustic array; Swarm Robotic for Autonomous underwater vehicle using acoustic 

communication; Development of accurate underwater simulator for robotics 

application; 3D-SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping) of autonomous 

underwater vehicles using Sonar and Vision.</b>
