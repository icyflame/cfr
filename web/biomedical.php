Robotic systems for assistance and rehabilitation focus on providing missing movements 

and sensing, providing safer environments, and providing environments that make 

regaining movement-related function easier and faster. Robotic prosthetics and 

exoskeletons will provide dexterity, natural mobility, and sense of touch to missing 

or paralyzed limbs. These techniques are aimed at improving the patient’s motor 

performance, provide rigorous rehabilitation regimen, and shorten the duration of 

rehabilitation procedure, and provide objective data for evaluation of patient’s progress 

during and after the rehabilitation. We are currently interested in conducting experiments 

on <b>Electromyogram signal (EMG) based control architecture developments 

for prosthetic limb and rehabilitation aid such as exoskeleton and Study of 

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and sEMG based control interface for bionics limbs 

and rehabilitation aids.</b>
