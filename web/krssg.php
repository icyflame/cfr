KRSSG is a student research group under the Department of Computer Science and 

Engineering, primarily working on autonomous soccer playing robots. 

The group, consisting of mechanical, embedded electronics, artificial intelligence, and a 

techno-management team, is developing robots and systems for multiple international 

leagues, listed below.

<li>Robocup Small Size League, which has omni-directional robots with Dribbler and 

Kickers playing soccer.</li>

<li>3D Simulation League, has simulation of humanoids playing soccer, where AI is
