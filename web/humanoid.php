Humanoid robotics with bipedal walking has attracted several researchers and bright 

students worldwide, as these robots challenge the young minds with interesting problems. 

These range from bipedal walking, postural stability control, light weight mechanical 

design for efficient energy usage, intelligence in vision, gait, actions etc. There are also 

exciting research challenges in multi-robot interactions as in robo-soccer etc. In this 

project, the student-teams are working on models of developed adult-size humanoid 

robots with capabilities of <b>Environmental Perception</b> â€“ that senses the environment 

so as to follow a collision-free path; Adaptive Gait control that develops the motion 

trajectories of the robot, so that it can perform in an unknown environment with a stable 

foot placement algorithm;<b> Mechatronic system</b>, which involves the development of a 

robust mechanical system that can handle a wide range of environments and perform jobs 

like picking, throwing, swinging.
